\subsection{Pipeline debugging}

\assign{John}

What tools do we need to help pipeline developers with their everyday work?

\begin{itemize}

  \item{How do you go about debugging a \texttt{Task} that is crashing?}
  \item{Is \texttt{lsstDebug} adequate?}
  \item{Do we need an afwFigure, for generating plots, to go alongside \texttt{afwDisplay}, for showing images?}
  \item{What additional capabilities are needed for developers running and debugging at scale, e.g. log collection, identification of failed jobs, etc.}
  \item{What's needed from an image viewer for pipeline developers? Is DS9 or Firefly adequate? Is there value to the afwDisplay abstraction layer, or does it simply make it harder for us to use Firefly's advanced features?}
  \item{How do we view images which don't fit in memory on a single node?}
  \item{How do we handle fake sources? Is this a provenance issue?}

\end{itemize}
