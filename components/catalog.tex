\subsection{Catalog visualization tools}

Derived from \S\ref{sec:design:debug}.

It is important for developers to be able to easily interactively visualize large quantities of catalog data.
The Pyviz ecosystem (Holoviews/Datashader/Dask/Pandas) is designed for exactly this purpose, and so the QAWG recommends the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Including up-to-date PyViz packages in the LSST stack,
    \item Developing basic tools using this ecosystem that mesh with existing stack infrastructure (e.g., \texttt{Butler}, \texttt{AfwTable}),
    \item Providing training to developers on how to use it,
    \item Enabling users to use Dask to work with larger-than-memory data, either with the ability to spin up Dask clusters on demand, or (perhaps preferred) to have a central Dask cluster at the LDF to which users can connect.
