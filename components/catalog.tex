\subsection{Catalog visualization tools}

\assign{Lauren}

Derived from \S\ref{sec:design:debug}.

For visualizing bigger-than-memory catalogs. May include e.g. the capability
to spin up Dask clusters on demand, combined with
Holoviews/Datashader/whatever. Somebody who knows about this stuff needs to
write a summary...
