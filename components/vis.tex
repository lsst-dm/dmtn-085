\subsection{Guidance on visualization}
\label{sec:comp:vis}

\assign{Simon}
We decided that this section should first be seeded with contexts for visualization. We can then go through and give specific guidance.

Contexts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Notebooks in-line: matplotlib-ish
\item Dashboard like visualization: health status (grafana?)
\item Pipelines debugging visualization: both persisted PNGs and pop up vis
\item Purpose built QA visualization: Like the multisky plot from \texttt{qa\_explorer}
\item Exploratory: Single plots with interactivity, including zoom and pan
\item Linked plots: Interaction in one frame causes chnge of state in another plot
\item Image visualization: (covered elsewhere)
\item Publication plotting
\item Static plots for reports
\item Plotting from a non-notebook interactive setting
\item Rendering of cached time series: SQuaSH
\end{itemize}

Derived from \S\ref{sec:design:debug}.

We're requesting a set of guidelines for developers here, not a new framework
--- but that's still a concrete deliverable (it's just documentation, rather
than code). We might suggest that these guidelines be developed by a new WG,
per Simon's
suggestion\footnote{\url{https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/DM/Pipeline+Debugging+Design}}.
