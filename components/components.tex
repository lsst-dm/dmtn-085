\subsection{Catalog visualization tools}

\assign{Lauren}

Derived from \S\ref{sec:design:debug}.

For visualizing bigger-than-memory catalogs. May include e.g. the capability
to spin up Dask clusters on demand, combined with
Holoviews/Datashader/whatever. Somebody who knows about this stuff needs to
write a summary...

\subsection{Provenance}

\assign{Hsin-Fang}

The QAWG recognizes the importance of provenance and the
implementation of the provenance system will impact QA work
significantly.  We recommend high priority to finalize the design
and implementation of the provenance system.

The QAWG believes that the requirements on provenance tracking are
adequate as described in the Data Management Middleware Requirements
(\citeds{LDM-556}) and Data Management Data Backbone Services
Requirements (\citeds{LDM-635}). QA use cases provide no further
requirements.

With the current design of the Gen 3 Middleware, each dataset
can be linked to provenance information such as input datasets,
pipeline definition, configurations, and software version.
QC metric values will be Butler datasets so they will be associated
with specific data IDs, and their provenance can be traced like
other datasets.  The Gen3 Butler/SuperTask generated provenance is
the primary source of provenance in the QA use cases as the
Butler/SuperTask framework is responsible of producing provenance
in the Gen 3 Middleware design.  For production runs, the Data
Backbone Services may store additional provenance, for example from
the Batch Production Services, besides the Butler/SuperTask generated
provenance.

Regarding provenance of the database records, the QAWG does not
place a strong requirement on per-source provenance.  The current
design is that each database record in the production database is
either ingested from a file, of which the full provenance is traced,
or from an uniquely identifiable execution.  This design does not
directly provide detailed per-source provenance, such as what exact
input images acually contribute to the measurement of a particular
source, but the full inputs that can contribute to the source.  The
provenance tracking of synthetic sources is also unclear.  The QAWG
thinks most low-level information can be uncovered through the drill
down system (\S\ref{sec:design:drill}).  Diagnostic information can
also be computed in the pipeline codes and stored as additional
columns.  We recommend the tooling to investigate the composition
of coadds be made in the drill down system and does not put this
requirement in the provenance system.

The QAWG notes that some high level aggregate data products that
are derived from provenance data can be useful in QA work.  For
example, the number of images that contribute to each coadd patch
can be obtained from provenance data.  However, the QAWG are not
immediately convinced that it's worth spending significant time
investigating what aggregate products need to be considered.

  is a priority;}

\subsection{Standard format dataset package}
\label{sec:comp:lfs-dataset}

Derived from \S\ref{sec:design:test}.

\assign{Hsin-Fang}

The standard format of a dataset package is a ready-to-use Butler
repository and follows the format of a Butler repository as defined
in its corresponding obs package.  The format is configurable by
design, however, it is tied to the codes in the stack, so can change
from a software stack version to another.  Besides implementations
in the obs packages and Butler, other evolvement in the software
stack, such as handling of calibration data and reference catalog,
can also make a once-working repository incompatible.  Therefore,
maintenance is occassionally needed to ensure the usability of a
dataset package.  The QAWG recommends a per-dataset product owner.

The Obs Pkg WG \jira{RFC-393} is charged to re-design and refactor
the obs packages for maintainability and extensibility. We suggest
the Obs Pkg WG take into considerations in their design to mitigate
the close tie between a Butler repository and its obs package
implmentations, as well as adopt a common structure across different
cameras when possible.  After the refactoring, the obs packages
will rarely change so the dataset format will be more stable.  The
QAWG recommends prioritise the Obs Pkg WG.

In some cases, a dataset pacakge may contain additional data not
in the format of a Butler repository. We recommend the format as
described in DM Developer Guide Common Dataset Organization and
Policy \footnote{\url{https://developer.lsst.io/services/datasets.html}}
and expand the policy as needed.
