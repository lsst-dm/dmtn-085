\subsection{Catalog visualization tools}

\assign{Lauren}

Derived from \S\ref{sec:design:debug}.

For visualizing bigger-than-memory catalogs. May include e.g. the capability
to spin up Dask clusters on demand, combined with
Holoviews/Datashader/whatever. Somebody who knows about this stuff needs to
write a summary...

\subsection{Provenance}

\assign{Hsin-Fang}

The QAWG recognizes the importance of provenance and the
implementation of the provenance system will impact QA work
significantly.  We recommend high priority to finalize the design
and implementation of the provenance system.

The QAWG believes that the requirements on provenance tracking are
adequate as descirbed in the Data Management Middleware Requirements
(\citeds{LDM-556}) and Data Management Data Backbone Services
Requirements (\citeds{LDM-635}). QA use cases provide no further
requirements.

With the current design of the Gen 3 Middleware, each dataset
contains provenance information such as input data repositories,
immediate parents, task structure, configurations, and software.
QC metric values will be Butler datasets so they will be associated
with specific data IDs, and their provenance can be traced like
other datasets.  As the provenance system is a deliverable of both
the Gen 3 Middleware and the Data Backbone, the QAWG stresses the
importance of having one single source of truth for provenance.  We
believe this is in line with the current development plan of the
Gen 3 Middleware and the Data Backbone.  The Butler/SuperTask
generated provenance is the primary source of provenance in the QA
use cases.  For production runs, the Data Backbone may store
additional provenance, besides the Butler/SuperTask generated
provenance.

Regarding provenance of the database records, the QAWG does not
place a strong requirement on per-source provenance.  The current
design is that each database record in the production database is
either ingested from a file, of which the full provenance is traced,
or from an uniquely identifiable execution.  This design does not
directly provide detailed per-source provenance, such as what exact
input images acually contribute to the measurement of a particular
source, but the full inputs that can contribute to the source.  The
provenance tracking of synthetic sources is also unclear.  The QAWG
thinks most low-level information can be uncovered through the drill
down system (\S\ref{sec:design:drill}).  We recommend the tooling
to investigate the composition of that coadd be made in the drill
down system and does not put this requirement in the provenance
system.

The QAWG notes that some high level aggregate data products that
are derived from provenance data can be useful in QA work.  For
example, the number of images that contribute to each coadd patch
can be obtained from provenance data.  However, the QAWG are not
immediately convinced that it's worth spending significant time
investigating what aggregate products need to be considered.

  is a priority;}
