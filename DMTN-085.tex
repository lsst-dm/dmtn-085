This report constitutes the primary artefact produced by the DM \gls{qawg},
addressing its charge as defined in \citeds{LDM-622}.

The complete scope of ``\gls{qa} within \gls{dm}'' is too large to be
coherently addressed by any group on a limited timescale. Per its charge,
then, the \gls{qawg} has constrained itself to considering only those aspects
of \gls{qa} which are most directly relevant to the construction of the LSST
Science Pipelines. In particular, we have considered the tools which
developers need to construct and debug individual algorithms; tools which can
be used to investigate the execution of at-scale pipeline runs; and tools
which can be used to demonstrate that the overall system meets its
requirements (to ``verify'' the system). This deliberately excludes broader
requirements of Commissioning, Science Validation, or run-time
\gls{sdqa}\footnote{Effectively, code executed during prompt or data release
production processing to demonstrate that the data being both ingested and
released is of adequate quality.}.

This report consists broadly of three parts. In \S\ref{sec:approach}, we
describe the approach that the \gls{qawg} took to addressing its charge. In
\S\ref{sec:design}, we present a high-level overview of the systems that we
envisage the future DM comprising. Finally, In \S\ref{sec:comp} we identify
specific components --- which may be pieces of software, documentation,
procedures, or other artifacts --- that should be developed to enable the
capabilities we regard as necessary. In some cases, these components may be
entirely new developments; in others, existing tools developed by the \gls{dm}
subsystem may already be fit for purpose, or can be adapted with some effort.
We have noted when this is the case.

Finall,y in Appendix \ref{glo:main} we define a number of key terms which are
used throughout this report and which we we suggest be adopted throughout
\gls{dm} to provide an unambigous vocabulary for referring to QA topics.
