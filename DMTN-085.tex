\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\assign{John}

This report constitutes the primary artefact produced by the DM \gls{qawg},
addressing its charge as defined in \citeds{LDM-622}.

\section{Approach to the Problem}

\assign{John}

\subsection{Pipeline debugging}

\assign{John}

What tools do we need to help pipeline developers with their everyday work?

\begin{itemize}

  \item{How do you go about debugging a \texttt{Task} that is crashing?}
  \item{Is \texttt{lsstDebug} adequate?}
  \item{Do we need an afwFigure, for generating plots, to go alongside \texttt{afwDisplay}, for showing images?}
  \item{What additional capabilities are needed for developers running and debugging at scale, e.g. log collection, identification of failed jobs, etc.}
  \item{What's needed from an image viewer for pipeline developers? Is DS9 or Firefly adequate? Is there value to the afwDisplay abstraction layer, or does it simply make it harder for us to use Firefly's advanced features?}
  \item{How do we view images which don't fit in memory on a single node?}
  \item{How do we handle fake sources? Is this a provenance issue?}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Guidance on visualization}

\assign{Lauren}

We're requesting a set of guidelines for developers here, not a new framework
--- but that's still a concrete deliverable (it's just documentation, rather
than code). We might suggest that these guidelines be developed by a new WG,
per Simon's
suggestion\footnote{\url{https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/DM/Pipeline+Debugging+Design}}.

\subsection{Image viewer}

\assign{Trey}

There are two approaches to doing image visualization.  When a developer is working on a laptop with a
small amount of data and viewing image results locally then DS9 or an equivilent desktop application seems
to be the best solution.

In the case where the data is on some remote server then visualization needs to
be more advanced. Here we recommend using Firefly web based image visulization. A large Firefly server(s) near the
data will allow quicker and simpler visualization. The data is not required to be moved to the laptop to visualize.

To be effective for QA Firefly should have the following functionallity:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{Work as a standalone tool. }
  \item{Work with the afw.display API.}
  \item{Provide an API that allows a user to acess more advanced features than afw.display provides.
  Possibly afw.display API should be enhanced in certain cases.}
  \item{Work as an extension in Jupyter Lab. For example- click on a FITS file and see it show in Firefly.}
  \item{Work as a Jupyter Lab widget.}
  \item{Provide a way to show tabular data on images.}
  \item{Provide HiPS viewing.}
  \item{Work with all major QA use cases and ensure good performance.}
  \item{Implement full focal plane visualization.}
  \item
\end{itemize}

What else do we want here?


\subsection{Catalog visualization tools}

\assign{Lauren}

For visualizing bigger-than-memory catalogs. May include e.g. the capability
to spin up Dask clusters on demand, combined with
Holoviews/Datashader/whatever. Somebody who knows about this stuff needs to
write a summary...

\subsection{Provenance}

\assign{Hsin-Fang}

This section should note:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{That provenance is an immediate issue impacting QA work, so a solution
  is a priority;}

  \item{Some requirements as to the granularity at which provenance tracking
  is necessary for QA.}

\end{itemize}
