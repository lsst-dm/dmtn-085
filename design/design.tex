\subsection{Pipeline debugging}
\label{sec:design:debug}

\assign{John}

The group considering the requirements of Science Pipelines developers for
debugging explored a number of avenues to make developers lives easier. In
doing, so they identified a number of areas in which current systems could be
improved to boost both productivity and developer morale.

In particular, they considered three separate scenarios in which developers
will require support.

\subsubsection{A pipeline is segfaulting}

We considered the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item{A pipeline is failing with a segfault;}
\item{A developer recompiles the failing code with no optimization;}
\item{The unoptimized code is run through a memory analysis tool\footnote{e.g. \href{http://valgrind.org}{Valgind}.};}
\item{This gives some possible locations where arrays are being overrun;}
\item{The unoptimized code is run under \href{https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/}{GDB};}
\item{This includes the need to start in \href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html}{PDB} and attach GDB when the process enters the compiled C++ code;}
\item{Using the debugging utilities, the dev finds where the array is being overrun.}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{A \gls{ci} run shows a regression in a \gls{metric value}}
